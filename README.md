<h1>The project of DataMining</h1>
<h3>This project is made by Julien, Cyril, Zunzun and me.</h3>
<p>The data in this project is the customer data of a bank Portuguese, it has 17 attributes and there are 45211 records 
between May 2008 and November 2010.</p>
<p>Here, We analyse the data for predicting whether a client does a saving plan in this bank or finding the reason of failing to do a
saving plan in this bank for some client.</p>
<p><b>arbreDecision.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the final tree.</p>
<p><b>arbrefait.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the tree after doing some processings.(just has 3 nodes)</p>
<p><b>calNo.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to calculate the number of every node. (yes/no)</p>
<p><b>dataMing.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a small change that is based in general.py for the function classDayofWeek(filename), all data aren't in the same year</p>
<p><b>general.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;We classify the data, but there is a small faut for the function classDayofWeek(filename), all datas are defaultly in the same year by us.</p>
<p><b>prefaire.py</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretreatment of the original data in order to generate the decision tree.</p>
<p><b>bank.csv</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the original test data. (include 4521 datas)</p>
<p><b>presentationDataAnalysis.pptx</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is our presentation document.</p>
